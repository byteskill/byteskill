# ABOUT
Software innovation is dead, and Byteskill tries to mitigate that. Byteskil is an organization where we share software that tries to bring back that
innovation we have lost. Yet, Byteskill is much more than that it's a learning platform. We don't care if the software you've been developing has released 
onto the Byteskill network. We want you to learn from the software you've been developing. Byteskill provides learning resources and tools to make you a better 
programmer.
